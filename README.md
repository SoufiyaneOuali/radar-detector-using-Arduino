### The proposed project encompasses two essential functions aimed at enhancing road safety:

#### 1: High-speed vehicle detection, image capture, and secure transmission to the server.

#### 2: Intelligent vehicle safety.

<b>In the first task,</b> the radar system diligently calculates the velocity of vehicles. Once it identifies a vehicle exceeding the speed limit, it meticulously records the speed value and promptly captures an image of the vehicle. Subsequently, this valuable data is securely transmitted to the THINKSPEAK server for further analysis and processing. Notably, the vehicle is equipped with four sophisticated distance sensors, strategically positioned to monitor its surroundings from various angles, including front, rear, left, and right.

<b>Moving on to the second task,</b> while the vehicle is in motion, the aforementioned sensors continuously measure the distance between the vehicle and any potential obstacles. By rigorously evaluating these distances against predefined safety standards, the system effectively determines the vehicle's secure operational state. In such instances where the vehicle complies with safety regulations, the collected data is expediently shared with the THINKSPEAK server. However, if the system identifies an imminent collision risk, it promptly notifies the server and initiates a series of visible warnings in the form of red signals.

#### <i> Leveraging the wealth of gathered information, an intelligent model can be constructed to assess driver behavior, differentiating between good and poor practices. This invaluable insight empowers the system to make informed predictions regarding the likelihood of potential accidents, thereby fostering a proactive approach to road safety.</i>
